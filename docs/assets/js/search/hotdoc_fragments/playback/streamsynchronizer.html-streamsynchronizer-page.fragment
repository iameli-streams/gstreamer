fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"playback/streamsynchronizer.html#streamsynchronizer-page","fragment":"streamsynchronizer\nEnables gapless playback of heterogenous streams groups. This element is\nused inside playsink.\nstreamsynchronizer ensures only one stream group is active downstream at any\ngiven time. Whenever a pad receives a STREAM_START with a group-id\ndifferent than the current one the pad is blocked until all other pads also\nreceive a STREAM_START with the same group-id.\nOnce all pads have received a STREAM_START with the same group-id, the\nprevious group is completed and all the pads unblocked.\nWhen a group is completed, a patched GstSegment is emitted downstream so\nthat the running time 0 from upstream of the new group becomes the running\ntime of the end of the previous group.\n"});
