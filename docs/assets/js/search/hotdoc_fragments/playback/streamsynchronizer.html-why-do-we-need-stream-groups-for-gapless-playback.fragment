This is a lot of work, especially to get it done\ncorrectly.\nThe goal of streamsynchronizer and group-ids is to standardize a solution\nfor gapless playback so that applications don't have to implement it from the\nground up, and for that solution to be generalizable to the worst possible\ncases.\nEvery new stream group received upstream of streamsynchronizer is expected\nto start at running-time of zero. Hence, once the previous file is drained,\nyou can even remove a demuxer element and replace it by a demuxer for a\ndifferent format, and streamsynchronizer will take care of adjusting the\nsegment so that the data of the second file plays after the second.\nIf there is more than one stream within the same group (e.g. audio and video)\nthe shift will be done by the duration of the longest stream.\n"});
