Demuxers\nwill ensure that the streams they output from their srcpads share the same\ngroup-id.\nAnother example is an out-of-band .srt subtitles file. In this case, despite\nbeing a separate file, the subtitle stream should use the same group-id as\nthe video its meant to be used with, as they both need to be played together.\nuridecodebin3 takes care of this automatically.\n"});
