The other\ntimestamps will be interpollated from this one using the RTP timestamps.\nThis has the side effect that no drift compensation between the server\nand client is done, and over time the RTP timestamps will drift against\nthe client's clock. This can lead to buffers (and observed end-to-end\nlatency) to grow over time, or all packets arriving too late once a\nthreshold is reached.\nEnabling this property will timestamp all RTP packets with their receive\ntimes, which gets around the drift problem but can cause other problems\nif the server is sending data not smoothly in real-time.\nOnly applicable for RTSP over TCP or HTTP.\n\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWrite\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tDefault value :\tfalse\n\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.26\n\t\t\n"});
