The demuxer would parse the\nprotection information for a video/audio frame from its input data and use\nthis information to populate the GstStructure info field,\nwhich is then encapsulated in a GstProtectionMeta object and attached to\nthe corresponding output buffer using the gst_buffer_add_protection_meta\nfunction. The information in this attached GstProtectionMeta would be\nused by a downstream decrypter element to recover the original unencrypted\nframe.\nIn addition to the GstProtectionMeta demuxers signal encrypted streams with\nspecific caps. The caps GstStructure name will usually depend on the\nencryption scheme, for instance Common Encryption will be signaled with\napplication/x-cenc. To prevent loss of information the media type of the\ndecrypted stream will be stored in a original-media-type string field.\nDownstream elements can re-use that information, for instance decryptors can\nset their source pad caps according to the original-media-type received on\ntheir sink pad.\n"});
