By\ndefault scaling can happen either in the source (if the source doesn't have\na specific size, like videotestsrc or mixing has\nbeen disabled) or in the mixing element otherwise, when adding that element\nas an effect, GES guarantees that the scaling will happen in it. This can\nbe useful for example if you want to crop the video before scaling or apply\nrounding corners to the video after scaling, etc...\n\n"});
