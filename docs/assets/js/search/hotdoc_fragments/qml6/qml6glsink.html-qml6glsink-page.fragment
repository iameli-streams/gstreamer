This is achieved by providing the incoming OpenGL\ntextures to Qt as a scene graph object.\nqml6glsink will attempt to retrieve the windowing system display connection\nthat Qt is using (#GstGLDisplay).  This may be different to any already\nexisting window system display connection already in use in the pipeline for\na number of reasons.  A couple of examples of this are:\nIf one of these scenarios occurs, then there will be multiple OpenGL contexts\nin use in the pipeline.  This means that either the pipeline will fail to\nstart up correctly, a downstream element may reject buffers, or a complete\nGPU->System memory->GPU transfer is performed for every buffer.\nThe requirement to avoid this is that all elements share the same\nGstGLDisplay object and as Qt cannot currently share an existing window\nsystem display connection, GStreamer must use the window system display\nconnection provided by Qt.  This window system display connection can be\nretrieved by either a qml6glsink element, a qml6gloverlay element, or a\nqml6glmixer element. The recommended usage is to have either element\n(qml6glsink, or qml6gloverlay, or qml6glmixer) be the first to\npropagate the GstGLDisplay for the entire pipeline to use by setting either\nelement to the READY element state before any other OpenGL element in the\npipeline.\nIn the dynamically adding qml6glsink (or qml6gloverlay, or qml6glmixer)\nto a pipeline case, there are some considerations for ensuring that the\nwindow system display and OpenGL contexts are compatible with Qt.  When the\nqml6gloverlay (or qml6glsink, or qml6glmixer) element is added and\nbrought up to READY, it will propagate it's own GstGLDisplay using the\nGstContext mechanism regardless of any existing GstGLDisplay used by the\npipeline previously.  In order for the new GstGLDisplay to be used, the\napplication must then set the provided GstGLDisplay containing GstContext\non the pipeline.  This may effectively cause each OpenGL element to replace\nthe window system display and also the OpenGL context it is using.  As such\nthis process may take a significant amount of time and resources as objects\nare recreated in the new OpenGL context.\nAll instances of qml6glsink, qml6gloverlay, and qml6glmixer will\nreturn the exact same GstGLDisplay object while the pipeline is running\nregardless of whether any qml6glsink or qml6gloverlay elements are\nadded or removed from the pipeline.\n"});
