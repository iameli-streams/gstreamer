More precisely, the tags written are ID3 version 2.4.0 tags (which\nmeans in practice that some hardware players or outdated programs might not\nbe able to read them properly).\nApplications can set the tags to write using the GstTagSetter interface.\nTags sent by upstream elements will be picked up automatically (and merged\naccording to the merge mode set via the tag setter interface).\n"});
