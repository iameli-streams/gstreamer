As a general matter, channels are always ordered\nin the GST_AUDIO_CONVERT_INPUT_CHANNELS_REORDER_GST order and the\nchannel-mask field in the audio caps allows specifying which channels are\nactive.\nDepending on the selected mode (see:\nGST_AUDIO_CONVERT_INPUT_CHANNELS_REORDER_MODE_UNPOSITIONED), input channels\ncan be automatically positioned when the channel-mask is not specified or\nequals 0. In this case, all input channels will be positioned according to\nthe selected reordering configuration and the index of each input channel.\nThis can be useful when importing audio from an array of independent\nmicrophones for example.\nThe reordering configuration can also be forced (see:\nGST_AUDIO_CONVERT_INPUT_CHANNELS_REORDER_MODE_FORCE) to reposition all\ninput channels according to each channel index. In this case the\nchannel-mask will be totally ignored and input channels will be reordered\njust like if they were unpositioned. This can be useful when importing\nmulti-channels audio with errors in the channels positioning.\nFor any of the former configurations, when the reordering is applied\n(input channels are unpositioned or the \"force\" mode is active):\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.26\n\t\t\n\nWhen there is only one input channel available, it is positioned to MONO\nalways, independently of the selected configuration.\nWhen there are 2 input channels available, they are positioned to\nFRONT_LEFT and FRONT_RIGHT (except for the\nGST_AUDIO_CONVERT_INPUT_CHANNELS_REORDER_MONO configuration where all\ninput channels are positioned to MONO).\n\n"});
