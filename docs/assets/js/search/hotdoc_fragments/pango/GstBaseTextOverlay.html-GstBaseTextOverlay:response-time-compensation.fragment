On some displays this can\ntake tens of milliseconds to complete, causing the previous frame's text\nrender to overlap with the current frame's text render.\nThis makes text renders that have the same position but change contents\nevery frame impossible to use on displays with bad response times, such\nas when using clockoverlay and timeoverlay.\nNote that this is different from display lag/latency, which is an\ninherent property of the display and cannot be compensated for.\n\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWrite\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tDefault value :\tfalse\n\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.26\n\t\t\n"});
